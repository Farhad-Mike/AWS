• AWS Regions
    AWS has Regions all around the world
    Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3...
    A region is a cluster of data centers
    Most AWS services are region-scoped
• AWS Availability Zones
    Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
      ap-southeast-2a
      ap-southeast-2b
      ap-southeast-2c
    Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
    They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters
    They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
• AWS Data Centers
• AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence

How to choose an AWS Region?:
  • Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
  • Proximity to customers: reduced latency
  • Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
  • Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

• AWS has Global Services:
    Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    Route 53 (DNS service)
    CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
    WAF (Web Application Firewall)
• Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
    Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
    Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
    Lambda (Function as a Service)
    Rekognition (Software as a Service)





############################# IAM & AWS CLI #############################


IAM: Users & Groups
  IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
  Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
  Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
  Groups only contain users, not other groups
  Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

IAM: Permissions
  Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
  These policies define the permissions of the users
  In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs


IAM Policies Structure:

• Consists of:
    Version: policy language version, always include “2012-10-17”
    Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
    Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
• Statements consists of:
    Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
    Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
    Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
    Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to
    Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)
